# Codes written and run when training using freeCodeCamp youtube channel video.

## [OpenCV Course - Full Tutorial with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXlwWbU8l2o)

# Notes:
 - ### I have updated the codes to work with newer versions in some of the instances.
 - ### I have done somethings different than in video.
